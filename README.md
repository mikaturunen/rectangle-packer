# retangle-packer
A simple rectangle packer for JavaScript (ES6), Node.js. Designed for packing bitmaps into an atlas to be used with WebGL rendering. It's a so called slobby seconds port of the [original][https://github.com/ChevyRay/RectanglePacker/] made for C#. This port is barely tested but aims to work as a starting point for someone who is interested in the actual algorithm but has hard time figuring out the C# code.

## Example

Check out the original repository and the test directory for random test nit bits.
